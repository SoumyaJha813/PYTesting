Cypress
1. Hybrid open source +paid services
2. Intentionally designed to work very different from Selenium
3. All in one test framwework, runner, automation API, graphical running environment
4. Javascript-only
5. Support for Chorme, plus some support for Edge and Firfox
6. Javascript-injecting proxy server intercepts and rewrites all browser requests to enable features.

TestCafe
1. Similar basic architecture to Cypress
2. Proxy server that injects Javascript in all pages under test
3. Javascript-only, just an automation API
4. Use with any browser and JS test environment

Puppeteer
1. Developed by Google for headless Chrome automation (running invisibly on the system without a full-fleged window that user can interact with)
2. Headless testing can increase testing speed while theoretically giving acurrate coverage
3. Javascript2-only
4. Works via Devtools/ remote debug protocol
5. Functional API for other tools (including WebdriverIO)
