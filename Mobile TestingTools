Landscape of Mobile Testing Tools:

Mobile Automation Tools:
1. Appium 
2. XCUITest 
3. Expresso 
4. UIAutomator
5. EarlGrey
6. Detox

XCUITest
1. Developed by Apple for testing the UI of iOS apps. iOS-only.
2. Tests written in objective-C or Swift, run with XCode.
3. Basic UI automation primitives(finding elements, taps, gestures)
4. Officially supported by Apple, with tight IDE integration
5. Appium's iOS support is based on XCUITest

Expresso
1. Automation library from Google, for Andriod Apps.
2. Tight integration with Andriod Studio.
3. Tests written with Java or Kotlin.
4. Gray-box instead of black-box testing model.
5. Knowledge of apps internals can lead to faster or more stable automation
6. Can't test just any app-- Expresso code bundled with your app.

UIAutomator
1. Older automation technology from Google, currently on version 2.
2. Only for Andriod: Java or Kotlin required for test writing.
3. Black-box approach to testing. Can automate entire device UI, including third-party apps.
4. Appium's standard Andriod support is powered by UIAutomator.

EarlGrey
1. Developed by Google, like Expresso but for iOS.
2. iOS framework bundled with tests, provide Expresso-like API within Xcode.
3. Gray-box approach: provided idle synchronization and app-internal code access.
4. Limited to iOS, using Objective-C or Swift, and testing only your app.

Detox
1. Designed especially for automation of React Native apps.
2. Node.js tools; tests must be written in javascript.
3. Wraps EarlGrey for iOS and Espresso for Android.
4. Same benefit and drawbacks as EarlGrey and Espresso, but in JavaScript package convenient for React Native developers.

Appium
1. Appium is more of a philosophical approach than a fundamental automation technology.
2. Appium makes the best automation technology available in a standard way.
3. Appium relies on other tools --XCUITest, UIAutomator2, Espresso...
